# Dear Bitcoin

A few seconds ago, Bitcoin transaction number 616,915,000 was made. There will be another 330,000 or so made in the next 24 hours and the total USD value of all those transactions will be around $55 billion. But what is a bitcoin transaction and why should you care?

Well, put simply, the more you understand what a transaction is – and isn’t – the less likely you will be to **** things up and lose everything!

Not much attention is paid to the humble transaction but, as I will attempt to explain, it’s a deceptively powerful thing.

Translated into plain English, it would read something like this:

*Dear Bitcoin Network*

*I hope this finds you well.*

*I would like to pay 50 bitcoins to my mate, who has, like me, plucked an extremely large number from the universe and has provided me with another large number, derived from the first, which – as I’m sure you know – will prove that he has the first number, without his needing to reveal it.*

*To fund this payment, I want to use the bitcoins I earned a while back - at 03.54 on the 1St September, to be precise.*

*I attach a very large number, which proves that I own those coins - without revealing the other large number. You know how it works!*

*Anyway, let me know if there’s any problem with it.*

*Bye for now.*

You can see what a bitcoin transaction actually looks like by looking it up on the blockchain. Here, for example, is a link to the 171st transaction ever made, which as we’ll discover was a significant one.

But what is this blockchain and, again, why should you care?

To answer that, we need to go right back to the beginning. To the Genesis
