# The Genesis Block

It’s 2009. Usain Bolt just set a new record for the 100m. Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It) is top of the charts. Donald Trump is creating an account on Twitter. 

And, oh yeah – I almost forgot – the global financial system has collapsed.

On the kitchen table is Satoshi’s copy of The Times. The front page reads:

*Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks*

Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto will launch to the World in a few hours, was not the first digital currency. Satoshi stands on the shoulders of cryptographic pioneers, such as David Chaum (DigiCash, 1989), Adam Beck (HashCash, 1997), Nick Szabo (Bit Gold 2005) and many others who were motivated to create an alternative to government-controlled money.

These early attempts had demonstrated that the decentralisation of currency was possible - that value could flow between individuals across the Internet without the need for central authorities, such as banks and governments. But they’d all ultimately come up against a fatal flaw: the double-spend problem. 

While it’s easy for your bank to know if you’ve got enough money to cover your next purchase, in a decentralised network this is surprisingly difficult to do. It’s an example of the Byzantine Generals Problem and it’s all about how to get a group of people to come to a consensus.

We’ll come back to these terms and go into more depth about the double-spend and why it’s such a dealbreaker.

But right now, Satoshi knows there’s a solution. It’s time to test it out.

At quarter past six on March 3rd 2009, the first Bitcoin transaction is created. It’s recorded in block zero of the Bitcoin blockchain.

You can [see it for yourself](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/0) on any blockchain explorer.

But what is this blockchain, and why is it about to change the concept of money forever?

To answer that, we’ll need to wait for block 171 and have a closer look at what a Bitcoin transaction really is.
